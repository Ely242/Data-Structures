# Data-Structures
Programming most if not all data structures in C

## Files

### stack.c
This file contains the implementation of the stack data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a stack, push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, and check if the stack is empty.

### queue.c
This file contains the implementation of the queue data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a queue, enqueue elements into the queue, dequeue elements from the queue, and check if the queue is empty.

### trie.c
This file contains the implementation of the trie data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a trie, insert words into the trie, search for words in the trie, and delete words from the trie.

### list.c
This file contains the implementation of the linked list data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a linked list, insert elements into the list and delete elements from the list.

### deque.c
This file contains the implementation of the deque (double-ended queue) data structure. It includes functions to initialize a deque, insert, delete, and peek from both ends of the queue, and check if the deque is empty.

### hash.c
This file contains the implementation of the hash table data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a hash table, insert key-value pairs into the table, search for values by key, and delete key-value pairs from the table.

### priority_queue.c
This file contains the implementation of the priority queue data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a priority queue, insert elements, remove the smallest element, and other related functions.
