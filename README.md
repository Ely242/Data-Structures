# Data-Structures
Programming most if not all data structures in C

## Files

### stack.c
This file contains the implementation of the stack data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a stack, push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, and check if the stack is empty.

### stack.h
This header file contains the declarations for the stack data structure and its associated functions. It defines the stack structure and provides the function prototypes for stack operations.

### queue.c
This file contains the implementation of the queue data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a queue, enqueue elements into the queue, dequeue elements from the queue, and check if the queue is empty.

### queue.h
This header file contains the declarations for the queue data structure and its associated functions. It defines the queue structure and provides the function prototypes for queue operations.

### trie.c
This file contains the implementation of the trie data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a trie, insert words into the trie, search for words in the trie, and delete words from the trie.

### trie.h
This header file contains the declarations for the trie data structure and its associated functions. It defines the trie structure and provides the function prototypes for trie operations.

### list.c
This file contains the implementation of the linked list data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a linked list, insert elements into the list and delete elements from the list.

### list.h
This header file contains the declarations for the linked list data structure and its associated functions. It defines the linked list structure and provides the function prototypes for linked list operations.

### deque.c
This file contains the implementation of the deque (double-ended queue) data structure. It includes functions to initialize a deque, insert, delete, and peek from both ends of the queue, and check if the deque is empty.

### deque.h
This header file contains the declarations for the deque data structure and its associated functions. It defines the deque structure and provides the function prototypes for deque operations.

### hash.c
This file contains the implementation of the hash table data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a hash table, insert key-value pairs into the table, search for values by key, and delete key-value pairs from the table.

### hash.h
This header file contains the declarations for the hash table data structure and its associated functions. It defines the hash table structure and provides the function prototypes for hash table operations.
