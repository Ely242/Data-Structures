Programming most if not all data structures in C

## Files

### stack.c
This file contains the implementation of the stack data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a stack, push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, and check if the stack is empty.

### stack.h
This header file contains the declarations for the stack data structure and its associated functions. It defines the stack structure and provides the function prototypes for stack operations.

### queue.c
This file contains the implementation of the queue data structure in C. It includes functions to initialize a queue, enqueue elements into the queue, dequeue elements from the queue, and check if the queue is empty.

### queue.h
This header file contains the declarations for the queue data structure and its associated functions. It defines the queue structure and provides the function prototypes for queue operations.
